        Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Rishab Nagwani</strong>, a student at VIT Vellore
        from Mumbai. This app is a <strong>Patreon Clone</strong> built using{" "}
        <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What This App Does</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        The main purpose of this application is to allow users to create an
        account and accept payments on behalf of themselves using the{" "}
        <strong>Razorpay payment gateway</strong>. It provides a seamless way
        for content creators and service providers to manage their subscriptions
        and payments efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How It Works</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        After signing up, users can set up their profiles and start accepting
        payments. The app securely integrates with Razorpay to handle all
        payment transactions, ensuring a smooth experience for both creators and
        their supporters.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why I Built This App</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        As a student, I noticed the growing need for platforms that help
        creators monetize their content. This app is my take on providing a
        user-friendly solution that makes it easier for creators to receive
        support from their fans. As of now, I&apos;m the only creator on this
        app as it is simply a project and not a production website; hence all
        payments are received in my personal bank account.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Get Involved</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I believe in community-driven development. If you have suggestions,
        feedback, or would like to contribute to this project, feel free to
        reach out!
      </p>
